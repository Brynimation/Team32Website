# 08/02/2021-14/02/2021 - Unit/Integration Testing, Report website updating.
In order to begin testing we installed the Unity Test Framework.
The majority of our tests are centred around our EventManager class, and are used to determine whether or not each event that can be fired triggers the correct action in response.
Additionally, we were able to work around a bug in the GLTFUtility library that was preventing us from loading non-embedded GLTF files, ie ones that would 
read textures from the same directory. Attempting to load such a file with the *LoadFromFile* method, which is what we have been doing, would lead to the Unity Editor (or build) becoming completely unresponsive and would require a forced shutdown. However, loading files *asynchronously* (using the *LoadFromFileAsync* method) not only negates this problem, but also ensures that the transition between the start scene and main scene is instant. Before, the user would be stuck on the start screen until the model had been fully loaded. Now, the user is taken straight to the main scene as soon as they press the view button. There is an issue here though; the model is not immediately loaded into the main scene anymore. Our solution to this was to add a loading screen that becomes inactive as soon as the model has loaded in. Although this is still not perfect, it means our GUI now provides more feedback to the user regarding what is happening in the loading process. Before, being stuck on the start screen for however many seconds communicated virtually no information to the user and could potentially be misidentified as the program crashing. We plan to look into Performance benchmark testing in Unity if there is time in the remaining weeks.
We've also started updating the project website.
