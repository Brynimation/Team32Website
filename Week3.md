# 26/10/2020 – 01/11/2020 - First Prototype

This week we built the first prototype of our app using Figma which is a very popular website for developers to design UI.<br>
[You can view it here](https://www.figma.com/proto/quo6iAuwTDs2te9PNm6VeN/Holorepository-prototype-1?node-id=3%3A22&scaling=scale-down)<br><br>

*Figure 1: The main page*<br><br>
As shown in Figure 1, our main page is very simple.<br>
In this interface, users can directly select the organ models they want to view, such as brain,kidney, lung and so on.<br>
After selecting the organ, users can view and edit the 3D model by clicking the “view” button in the lower right corner.<br><br><br>

Figure 2 shows the model editing interface. There are four buttons in the upper left corner of the image.<br>
The first button allows the user to move the model by dragging and dropping, the second button makes the model rotate, <br>
the third button removes all unsaved operations, namely restore the model, and the fourth button represents “exit”.<br>
Users can slide through the selector in the upper right corner and select the area they want to edit, and they can change<br> 
its color (the palette in the lower right corner) and transparency (not shown in this image). In addition, users can also add<br>
comments to the model to record symptoms, diagnosis and other information.
