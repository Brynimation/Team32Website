12/28/2020 - 01/03/2021 Week 12 -------------- UI Design.

According to the relevant knowledge of HCI that we have learned, we know that all the designs aim to make human's life more convient.
I have thought about our current design in Figma, it looks okay but it can still be improved.
The first point is that, the whole user interface is a bit colourful which may cause that user cannnot focus on the model.
    The main function of our application is to render the 3D model, which means the model is the most important and the only important thing in the whole UI.
Secondly, all the buttons don't have a uniform design style. Compared with the three buttons above the navigation bar, The icon for annotation looks totally different.
Thirdly, many people cannot understand what do some icons stand for,
    To give an example, people don't understand the meaning of the icon which is an arrow in a circle.
    (It's actually an un-do button by the way)
    
To solve these problems, a new design style has been applied -- the Neumorphism.
The whole scene looks very clean and clear in this design as the whole user interface in designed in white / black, the model can be highlighted very well.
Almost all the icons have been redesigned so that they are all in same style, which looks like stick figure.
We removed the "un-do" button and the "export" button because they are usually not needed.
A setting button has been added, but we have no ideas about what to put in the setting page. We will keep the setting button for a while,
    because every application needs a setting button. XD
