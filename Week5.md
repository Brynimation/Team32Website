## 09/11/2020 – 15/11/2020

Having completed our second interactive prototype last week, as well as completing our Human Computer Interaction coursework,  
we decided to schedule another meeting with our clients. In the meeting we showed a demo of our second interactive prototype  
over MS teams. The reception to the design was positive.<br><br>

We also created an initial draft of our MoSCoW list, but we know that these requirements (especially the “Should Have” and “Could Have” requirements)
are tentative and will most likely be subject to change over the course of the development of our first working prototype (between now and Christmas).  

**MoSCoW List Version 1**

**Must have**  

Cross platform application that must enable the user to:  
* Via a main menu, select (from a list of supported organs) which organ from the patient scan they want rendered.  
* Zoom in and out/rotate their view of the model by pinching and dragging.  
* Translate/rotate the model itself in 3D space.  
* Have a button that enables other UI components to be hidden to view the model in fullscreen.  
* Reset the position/orientation of the model back to default.  
* Change the colour of the background.  
* Change the transparency and colour of different organ segments. 
* Export to multiple 3D model formats.  
* Add/view annotations for each organ segment using an onscreen keyboard. 
* App must have a portrait and landscape mode.  

**Should have**
* Speech to text annotations.  
* FHIR interoperability.   
* User Centre: users can store different 3D models to the cloud and can use these data on different platforms (smartphone, tablet, laptop and desktop).  


**Could have:**

* Gesture navigation using camera/leap motion controller.  
* Support for multi-user access of the same model at a given time.  
* Version of the app for VR headsets (ie, Hololens 2).  
* Settings: to give us feedback if there are some bugs while running the app.  
* The ability to compare 2 different models (from 2 different patients) side by side.  

**Will not have**  

* Editing the polygons on the model itself.  
* Raytracing.  
* Realistic textures on the organs
