# 22/02/2021-28/02/2021 - DICOM viewer and Tooltips
Although our clients have been very receptive towards the design of our GUI, they've mentioned that the icons aren't necessarily intuitive so adding tooltips to the project might be a good way to make it more usable.  
I wanted these tooltips to be generated dynamically. Doing this required three new classes:  
*ToolTipCreator* is attached to the Canvas gameobject in the main scene. It searches all children of the canvas for Button and Toggle components and adds a *ToolTipComponent* to gameObjects with these components attached. The *ToolTip* class is a singleton with a reference to an image (textbox) and text. When the pointer hovers over a gameObject with a *ToolTipComponent* component attached, the *ToolTip* is enabled and its text set to the name of the gameObject with the attached *ToolTipComponent*. Dynamically generating these tooltips keeps the number of gameobjects in the scene lower (and is cool).<br>

I also needed to get started on the ability to allow the user to view DICOM scans in a panel. In researching the DICOM standard I quickly became aware that loading a DICOM scan into Unity would be anything but trivial, so I found an [open source library](https://github.com/fo-dicom/fo-dicom) that allows a .dcm to be converted into a Texture2D object.
When the user clicks the relevant button on the navigation bar, the fileExplorer opens and the paths they selected are loaded into a Texture2D array. These Texture2D objects are loaded onto a Unity Image component witin the panel. Using a slider, the user can view all the dicoms/texture2D objects in the array.

This week I had a conversation with Dr Mohemedally about the reduction of our requirements due to Shuai's continued absence. He was extremely sympathetic to the problems we have faced as a team. As a result, we've agreed that it's acceptable for the application to be a Windows application (as long as it's portable). Furthermore, the requirement regarding opening the application from a URL link is now a low priority, and should be dealt with (if we have time) after we've done testing, updated the report website, etc.

I spoke again with Dr Mohemedally and another one of my clients, Sheena Visram, and they seemed happy with the DICOM viewer feature. One of the last remaining things to do now before we can start testing is to create a settings controller, that allows different UI elements to be enabled/disabled and also allows the brightness of the background to be changed. As of the end of this week, that's nearly completed.
On Sunday I got confirmation that Shuai is okay and is able to contribute to the project again from now.
