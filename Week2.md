# 19/10/2020 â€“ 25/10/2020 - UI Sketching

After we thought about what our software can do, we started to design the User Interface (UI).<br>
In this week, we sketched the basic look of the UI.<br>
We first decided that the app should be used horizontally, so that the 3D models can be displayed in a greater space.<br>
Secondly, we discussed the functions that this app can achieve and arranged these function icons on the interface clearly.<br>
We also had some discussion about background colour, but we had no conclusion yet. We were quite optimistic about this sketch.<br>
