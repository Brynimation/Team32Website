* We decided to streamline our development process by using Unity Teams Collaboration and Cloud Build. GitHub proved to be a suboptimal choice for collaboration in Unity, and this will now allow us to collaborate better. Cloud Build also automatically builds the project every time a new change is pushed.  
* The segment selector is now tied to the opacity slider, so the opacities of all layers can be adjusted individually, as well as being able to view them all individually.  
* There’s been a start to the annotation system, though it will take some time to work out how exactly we will be implementing it.  
* We had another meeting with our clients, where we showed our progress by screen sharing. Some new ideas have been brought up, and previous ones expanded upon. For example, Costas suggested the idea of a plane that can be cut through the model to view a sort of cross section of the model. We’ve also been told to look further into RESTful API, such that a link can open our app and show a specific model, perhaps from a specific angle with specific annotations.
