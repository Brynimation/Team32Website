## 30/11/2020 – 6/12/2020

This week’s focus was working on the Unity project itself, as we want something we can show by the end of term.  
* We added the functionality to select which segment to view exclusively. This is a step towards the segment selector that we want and will eventually tie in with the rest of the UI.  
* We added the functionality to change the opacity of one segment. We’ve run into a visual bug where segments seem to appear/disappear when being viewed through a transparent segment, and hope to find a way to fix this.  

We also  had a meeting with an NHS radiologist, Owen Arthurs, to gather insight from someone who has experience with DICOM scan software, and also had a good idea of what would be required in an application such as the one we’re developing. 
We were guided through the Windows software he used, which can display DICOM scans taken from multiple angles together, and contains features we’re still looking to implement such as adding annotations. We recorded the meeting to look back on for future reference. 
One big distinction is that the radiology software he used is for mouse and keyboard control, while our application should support touchscreen use, so we have to do some things differently. However, based on our discussion with Dean last week, the fact that Intel is our main client suggests that building a mobile version of the application is less important than getting something that works on an intel based laptop.
Although we made good progress in regards to the segment selection functionality this week, we ran into a pretty significant problem on creating our first actual Unity Build. Up to this point we had been testing the functionality of our system within the Unity editor exclusively, which was an error. The model wouldn’t load in the actual build. This required an enormous of debugging and ate into the time we could’ve spent looking into implementing other features. However, it’s good that we encountered this issue relatively early and now that it’s fixed, it shouldn’t re-emerge as an issue.
