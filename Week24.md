This week the our main areas of concern have been:
* updating the project website.
* preparing our slides for our final demo with Dr Yun
* preparing for our final meeting with our TA, where we will demonstrate our project and describe how/why we made certain decisions in order to implement certain features

For the project website, I have taken charge of the *Design* and *Implementation* sections as I have been the lead programmer on the project. Shuai will be updating the *Home*, *HCI*, *Requirements* and *Evaluation* pages of the website.

We did, however, have some additional features to implement. 
In (this blog post)[https://github.com/Brynimation/Team32Website/edit/gh-pages/Week18.md] I mentioned that our application had been tested by a third year student, whose final year project 
uses touchless gesture for inputs. One issue that he came across was that he was unable to zoom in, as no mapping existed between the mouse scrollwheel and his application. Therefore, I created keybinds for the W and S keys that zoom the camera in and out respectively.  
I also added two new elements to the GUI that perform the same function.

Furthermore, in a conversation I had with Dean this week he mentioned how important it was that our application could allow for the viewing of models of eyes. Another third year
student had a half completed GLB model of the eye which is now included as one of the example models in our application. Over email he mentioned that "it doesn't look anything like an eye, but that's because it's a 3D render of a 2D segmented image and is missing a dimension of data that had to be manually created."

Also ran into a github issue. Great
