                    The displacement (in the z axis) of the camera from the pivot is determined by the movement of the Scroll wheel. Every frame, the camera's position is set to the pivot about which it is rotating, but is then translated away from the

                    This radius is also used to determine the <i>scrollspeed</i> attribute of the CameraController class, which means the speed at which the user can zoom in is

                     This directory is initialised as soon as the model is loaded into the program for the first time, in the same directory that the application runs in.

                    encapsulated by the AnnotationData object received (for instance, CameraController restores camera position,rotation and displacement, ModelHandler restores the colours of the model segments, etc).

                <!-- CROSS SECTIONAL VIEWER -->


                <h3 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Cross Sectional Viewer</h3>
                <p class="text-body">To implement this feature we made use of <i>surface shaders</i> written in High Level Shader Language.
                    Surface shaders provide a code generation approach to writing shaders that interact with light in Unity. 
                    The concept that our cross-sectional view shader employs is similar to the idea of  <i>occlusion culling</i>, in which an object will only be rendered by a camera if it is between the near and far clipping planes of the camera. 
                    If an object is partially between these two planes, only its polygons between the two planes will be drawn to the screen.
                    Our shader (which we based heavily on <a href="url">this open-source shader</a>, as well as the shaders included in the GLTFUtility library that were already being used) determines which pixels of the model should not be drawn to the screen,
                    based on the position and orientation of a plane that is controlled by the user using sliders.<br> If the <b>dot product</b> of:
                    <ui>
                        <li>The distance between the <i>world space</i> position of a vertex on the mesh of the model and the centre of the plane and</li>
                        <li>The plane's normal</li>
                    is positive, then the current pixel is <b>above</b> the plane, so is discarded.
                </p>
                <p>Below I've included the shader itself</p><br>

                <p class="text-muted">The <b>surface function</b>, which fills in the <b>SurfaceOutputStandard</b> struct. This ultimately defines how the model is rendered.</p>
                <p class="text-body">This is the shader that is applied to the model after it has first loaded in (in the <b>loadModel</b> coroutine in the <i>Model Rendering and Initialisation section</i>).
                    However, initially, all of the model's geometry is visible due to the plane being initialised with a y position of <i>modelCentre +modelRadius</i>, which will always be greater than the height of
                    the model itself as this radius represents the bounding sphere of the renderer of the model.
                    When the user first presses the cross-sectional view icon, the plane controller is enabled and a different shader is applied to the model. This shader turns the pixels above the plane black.

                <p class= "text-body">The user then controls the plane by means of sliders. One slider controls the y position of the plane, while the other three control the orientation of the plane about the x,y and z
                    axes. This is an example of the type of callback action that is passed to a slider.

                and normal of the plane being controlled by the user.</p>
