                    <p style="color: rgb(222,222,222);">The first stage of our requirements gathering involved meetings and interviews with our clients. These meetings enabled us to gain a better understanding of what we needed to build, and in doing so allowed us to establish an initial set of must-have requirements.<br>To further our requirements gathering we carried out semi-structured interviews with pseudo-users. We chose to carry out semi-structured interviews to ensure that we would always get answers to the questions we had prepared, but also allowed us to probe deeper by asking additional questions if the interviewee said anything insightful that we had not considered initially. This ensured that the requirements we gathered were a truer reflection of what a user would look for in a medical model viewer application.<br>Over the course of the development of our project, we met with our clients on a weekly basis. Our requirements have been expanded upon and subject to change over the course of development based on the requests of our clients, but by meeting and demonstrating our progress frequently, we've ensured that our application is indeed delivering what our clients had in mind.</p>

He prides himself on his&nbsp;compassion for his patients and understands how stressful any sort of medical scan&nbsp;can be. After a scan of a patient revealed a treatable problem with the patient, he&nbsp;printed out an image of the scan. He wanted to use this image to help the patient&nbsp;understand what was wrong so he could better explain how treatment was going to&nbsp;work. Unfortunately, the nature of the problem made the explanation difficult and&nbsp;the scan not particularly informative to the patient. Highlighting what made the&nbsp;scan a-typical proved difficult, and he felt unable to ease the patient.&nbsp;​</h3><img class="border rounded shadow-lg" data-aos="zoom-in-up" data-aos-duration="400" src="assets/img/Requirement_section/persona_newDrouse.png" style="max-width: 80%;margin-top: 70px;">

He finds himself having to regularly liaise with&nbsp;radiologists regarding his patients’ scans. One instance of such a case found him and a&nbsp;radiologist viewing a patient’s CT scan. He spotted a minor abnormality which his&nbsp;partner had not. Attempting to explain the issue proved very frustrating. His partner&nbsp;disagreed that there was an issue, leaving Drouse feeling angry. As an intelligent man&nbsp;he was certain of what he saw. Drouse felt limited in his explanation by his inability to&nbsp;interact with the scan. If he could’ve zoomed in on and annotated the problem area,&nbsp;he’s sure there would’ve been zero conflict.&nbsp;​</h3><img class="border rounded shadow-lg" data-aos="zoom-in-up" data-aos-duration="400" src="assets/img/Requirement_section/persona_3.png" style="max-width: 80%;margin-top: 70px;">

He often tried to share his enthusiasm with his students, but some of them weren't interested and some didn't even understand what he was talking about. Once he was explaining to his students how the human kidney filters urine and extracts water from it, but the students didn't understand how a kidney works. Repeating the explanation over and over again made him physically and mentally tired, but he did not give up. He believes a human organ model rendering program could help a lot.</h3>

          1. HoloRepository 2020 for Azure and HoloLens 2. Works with the newly released HoloLens 2 and facilitates the cloud storage of 3D models.<br>
          2. HoloRepository 2020 for NUCs. Mainly built for clinical research.<br>
          3. HoloRepository 2020 Viewer. This is a tool designed for clinicians to teach with that uses the Holopipelines to convert from CT and MRI DICOM scans to 3D GLB models.[2]</p>
        <p class = "text-muted mb-0">The HoloRepository 2020 Viewer serves as a very useful point of comparison for our application, as it is a 3D model viewer application built to run locally.
            Seeing the HoloRepository 2020 viewer in operation [9] has been extremely useful, particularly in the early stages of sketching and prototyping when trying to consider what
            users would require from a 3D medical model viewer application. Some of the features in particular stuck out to us as extremely useful:
            <ul class = "text-muted mb-0">
                <li>The ability to change the colour of a loaded model</li>

        <h2>Unity and why it's a good choice for our application</h2>
          <div class="tab-pane fade px-4 py-5 show active">
            <p class="text-muted">Unity is a cross-platform game engine initially released for Mac OS X in June 2005.[6]  It is a good choice of technology for our purposes because, as a Game Engine, it must offer fast real time rendering[10].
                This is hugely important for us, as it will enable us to offer a performant experience to users even when viewing the extremely complex meshes that can be generated from patient scans. <br><br>

                Furthermore, Unity also keeps a number of the complex ideas underpinning computer graphics abstract and easily accessible to the programmer, which will be useful for us as we are new to
                the field of computer graphics. For instance, Unity provides two ways of accessing and manipulating the properties of a mesh: using the <i>simple API </i> or using the <i>advanced API</i>.[10]<br><br>
                
                Another reason that Unity is a good choice is that the main language that it supports is C#. C# is an object-oriented, statically typed language[8] for which there exists a wealth of well maintained tutorials and documentation online. Being able to work
                using such a well established, and compared to some languages such as C++, easy to learn language will help development as straightforward as possible. The point about there being a number of tutorials available for C# holds true for Unity specifically as well, which
                will, again, be very beneficial as we are all approaching this project with very little experience in this field.<br>
                <br>

    <h2>GLTFUtility v.s. UnityGLTF</h2>
      <div class="tab-pane fade px-4 py-5 show active">
          
        <p class="text-muted">As Unity does not natively support GLB and GLTF files, an open-source library is needed. As loading GLB and GLTF files is such an important part of our project, it was important that we chose the right library. The two main ones we came across in our research were:<br>
          1. GLTFUtility:<br>
          This library is developed by Siccity, who both updates the library himself and manages pull requests from other developers frequently.[3] The library being active is a good sign that if bugs are discovered they will be found. The creator has commented that "GLTFUtility is built with a primary focus on simplicity, does not use external libraries, and can easily navigate to potential contributors. It's plug and play.[5]" This description is very apt.<br>
          2. UnityGLTF:<br>
          This library is developed by KhronosGroup, the creators of the GLTF file format. UnityGLTF boasts a greater number of features than GLTFUtility, but at the expense of a much more complicated set-up process. However, because of its complexity, UnityGLTF becomes a bit messy and many set-ups need to be prepared while using.[5]Additionaly, both pull requests and commits to the main branch of the GitHub repository are far less frequent than that of GLTFUtility.[4]<br><br>
         As we do not require any of the more complex functionalites offered by UnityGLTF, we have chosen to use GLTFUtility due to its very simple set-up process and easy to use API for importing GLB and GLTF files into Unity at runtime.

In addition, the whole UI design was too colourful and may cause users to lose focus on the model while using our application.</p>

Its advantage is that the screen is extremely simple, easy to highlight the main body, and will give the user the feeling of&nbsp; "this software is very easy to use".</p>

                <h3 class = "section-heading text-uppercase">Design Patterns</h3>
                <h4 class = "my-3">Singleton pattern</h4>
                <p class = "my-3"> A number of the classes in our codebase are dependent on the properties of the loaded model (such as its centre and radius). The <b>ModelHandler</b> class  
                    holds a reference to the <b>Organ</b> object, which is an abstract class that represents the loaded model. The ModelHandler class is responsible for loading in the Organ (see the <i>Model loading and initialisation</i> class diagram below), but also calculating the properties of the loaded Organ that the other classes rely on.
                    In order to provide other classes ease of access to these properties, ModelHandler is made a singleton. Although the Singleton pattern is often seen as an antipattern, its use here is appropriate
                    as only one model is ever loaded into the application at any given time. Our <b>EventManager</b> class (see below) is also a singleton.
                </p>
                <h4 class = "my-3">Publisher-Subscriber pattern</h4>
                <p> To reduce the dependencies between classes in our codebase we utilised the Publisher-Subscriber pattern. To do this, we created the <b>EventManager</b> class. The EventManager holds a reference to a number of different events, each of which is designed to trigger a certain action within the application. Each event has a corresponding public method which can be called to invoke the event. As the class is a singleton, any class can trigger these events without a reference to the EventManager, and any class can subscribe to these events without a reference to the EventManager.  
                    So for instance, a button can fire an event when clicked. Any scripts that relate to this button will subscribe to this event. However, these scripts do not break if this button is deleted, nor does the button break if the scripts are deleted. Neither party requires a reference to one another as all communication is handled by the EventManager. Any class that listens for events implements the <b>IEventManagerListener</b> interface.</p>
                <h4 class = "my-3">Factory pattern</h4>
                <p>Our application is shipped with six example glb models that can be viewed by the user. These can be selected from a dropdown menu. Each example model is represented by a corresponding class that is a subclass of the abstract Organ class. We use the <b>OrganFactory</b> class to instantiate the appropriate subclass of Organ
                based on the model chosen to view by the user at runtime. If the user chooses to load a model from local storage, the default concrete subclass of the abstract Organ class is instantiated. </p>

                    we made use of <a href="https://github.com/Siccity/GLTFUtility">GLTFUtility</a>, an open source library that supports runtime import of GLB/GLTF files into Unity. It converts the data in the GLB/GLTF files into a number of Unity GameObjects with a MeshFilter
                    ,MeshRenderer and Material component attached. Each of these GameObjects represents a segment of the loaded model.

                    prevents them from needing to hold a reference a ModelHandler object.

                    is a public method of the <b>Transform</b> class provided in the UnityEngine namespace. All Unity GameObjects have a Transform component attached that describes its position and orientation in the scene.
                    The displacement (in the z axis) of the camera from the pivot is determined by how much the user has zoomed in/out on the view of the model.
                    Every frame, the camera's position is set equal to the position of the pivot. It is then rotated using the rotate method, and translated away from the 
                    pivot using the <b>Translate</b> method. This creates the desired effect, in that the camera is always centered on the pivot.
                </p>

                    This radius is also used to determine the <i>scrollspeed</i> attribute of the CameraController class, which means the speed at which the user can zoom in is 
                    proportional to the size of the model.

                <b>startPos + (TargetPos - startPos) * ratio</b>, where <b>ratio</b> is the ratio of the elapsed time since the camera started resetting to the desired total reset time,
                which is set to 2 seconds in our application. When the ratio is one, the Camera's position will be equal to the target position and the lerp function will no longer be called.

                    Surface shaders provide a code generation approach to writing shaders that interact with light in Unity. 
                    The concept that our cross-sectional viewer shader employs is similar to the idea of  <i>occlusion culling</i>, in which an object will only be rendered by a camera if it is between the near and far clipping planes of the camera. 
                    If an object is partially between these two planes, only its polygons between the two planes will be drawn to the screen.
                    Our shader (which we based heavily on <a href="url">this open-source shader</a>, as well as the shaders included in the GLTFUtility library that were already being used) determines which pixels of the model should not be drawn to the screen,
                    based on the position and orientation of a plane that can be controlled by the user using sliders.<br> If the <b>dot product</b> of:

                    the model itself as this radius represents the bounding sphere of the renderer of the model.
                    When the user first presses the cross-sectional view icon, the plane controller is enabled and a different shader is applied to the model. This shader turns the pixels above the plane black, but is otherwise

As our application is built in Unity, the majority of our classes inherit from the MonoBehaviour class. Unlike other classes in C#, MonoBehaviours cannot be instantiated directly, but must be instead attached to an existing Unity GameObject using the&nbsp;<em>AddComponent&lt;&gt;</em>&nbsp;function. Furthermore, due to a number of classes being dependent on the loaded model, testing individual modules of code proved difficult.&nbsp;</p>

Namely, we wrote tests to verify that the Events of our EventManager class could be invoked and received by the relevant listener classes, whether the models were being loaded with the expected number of segments and that our AnnotationData objects could be parsed to and from JSON.</p>

Our clients would provide us with feedback on the project with each iteration we sent, often making suggestions on how things could be changed. Although this testing was relatively informal, it was hugely beneficial in that:
<ul>
<li>It allowed our clients to have a hands-on experience of using our application, which made it much easier for them to comment on our progress (compared to us simply sharing our screen and demonstrating our progress). This made the feedback they 
                            provided more valuable, as the feedback was generated from actual experience using the application. The following requirements from our MoSCoW list were actually gathered from our clients testing and providing feedback on iterations of the application:
                        <ul>
                            <br>
                            <li>Have tool-tips appear over elements of the GUI when the pointer hovers over them.</li>
                            <li>Allow the user to change the position about which the camera is centred.</li>
                            <li>Have a full-screen mode of the application, which hides all GUI elements. </li>
                            <li>Allow the user to change the brightness of the background.</li>
                            <br>
                        </ul> 
                        <li>In addition to testing usability, this process served as a form of compatibility testing. Sending these builds allowed us to verify that our application would run correctly on Windows devices beyond the devices we were using for development. Specifically, we were able to verify 
                            that our GUI scaled well for different screen sizes.
                        </li>

                    <p>At the very end of development, we sent the final build of the project to potential users of the project and asked them to provide feedback. Though we were unfortunately unable to carry out user acceptance testing with actual clinicians, we hope that this information is useful if the HoloRepository Portable 2021 is ever iterated upon.</p>

                                <li>The user interface provided a very pleasant experience. Everything was clear, and the labels which appeared when hovering over the icons made things easy to understand.</li> 
                                <li>Movement of the segmentation viewer was intuitive and very easy to control. </li>
                                <li>The opacity feature is really unique; it provides easy visual access to inner segments of the organ. Amazing design for viewing annotations. It was very useful to have the program teleport to the exact point where the annotation was saved.</li>
                                <li>The cross section feature was very versatile which improved visualisation.</li><br>

                            <li>The colour wheel was a bit tedious to spin around.</li>
                            <li>Adding a pan feature on the middle mouse button alongside the keyboard controls would improve ease of use.</li>
                            <li>It would be optimal if the opacity slider is unique to each segment, resetting when viewing each segments.</li>
                            <li>Providing an option to change size of the navigation bar, colour wheel and all other features on the UI would allow for easier visualisation especially when zooming into intricate sections of the segmentation.</li>

                                <li>Having the labels pop-up over the different icons was really helpful.</li>
                                <li>I loved being able to create the cross-sectional views - the way the part of the brain turned black before it disappeared was fantastic</li>
                                <li>I thought the way the annotations saved the view of the model could be extremely helpful, especially if you wanted to show someone a very specific part of the organ.</li>

                                <li>The pivot definitely shouldn't have been white. It made it pretty difficult to see.</li>
                                <li>I think the colour of the text in the labels should change based on the background colour - when the background was black the labels were difficult to read.</li>
                                <li>I think the reset camera button should also reset the position of the pivot. The way the model jumps if you reset the position while the pivot is not centred is disorientating.</li>

As the whole user interface is designed in the style of Neumorphism,&nbsp;we believe our UI meets our goals. All images in our application (except for the clients' logos) are designed by using Adobe Photoshop. In order to improve the user experience, we sent our application to our clients, friends and families, and received a lot of positive feedback from them. After constant modification and attempt, our UI becomes better. To give an example, we modified some icons to make their appearance and function do match. And since our users have a wide range of ages, this simple and intuitive design will make it easier for older users to use, while still being fashionable. As a result, we have a lot of confidence in our UI. </p>

                                                <p class="description">Over the course of the project, we scheduled weekly meetings with our clients and would aim to demonstrate a new feature/improvement to an existing feature at each meeting. This helped us feel less overwhelmed by how huge 
                                                    the project we were undertaking felt, and ultimately helped us manage our time better.<br>
                                                    As our project is built in Unity, we were able to make use of the services Unity Collaborate and Unity Cloud Build. This meant that whenever we pushed any new code to the cloud, a new build of our project would be created. This helped save
                                                    time in creating new builds manually and made our workflow much smoother. <br>
                                                    However, one area in which our project management could've been improved was how much we communicated outside of our client meetings. We did communicate over MS teams, but it was sometimes difficult to get a hold of one another and this led to long periods 
                                                    of time when no communication was made.
                                                    Furthermore, our project became very difficult to manage when Shuai lost internet connection for three weeks and the team consisted of just Bryn. After this happened it was very difficult to re-establish a robust project plan and did make the 
                                                    few weeks of development extremely difficult./p>

    <ul>
<li>Our application could be fully  integrated into the existing HoloRepository ecosystem. In an ideal world, a clinician would be able to select a patient scan, which would then be immediately converted into a GLB model and loaded and rendered by our application. Using our DICOM viewer feature, the original patient scans could then be viewed along-side the newly generated 3D model. </li>
<li>Secondly, higher fidelity rendering of the models could be carried out, which could involve more detailed texturing and raytracing. This is something that is already being looked into by a third year student.</li>
<li>Thirdly, the application could be made cross platform, so that clinicians and educators could use it on other Operating systems, as well as  their phones and tablets.</li>
<li>Finally, the ability to open the application from well formatted URL links. The parameters of these links could include the model file to be loaded, along with the attributes of the AnnotationData class that we are currently using to store a given view of the model. Clicking on one of these links would render the model passed as the parameter, and immediately take the user to the view of the model determined by the other parameters. </li>
