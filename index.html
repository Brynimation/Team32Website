                    <p style="color: rgb(222,222,222);">The first stage of our requirements gathering involved meetings and interviews with our clients. These meetings enabled us to gain a better understanding of what we needed to build, and in doing so allowed us to establish an initial set of must-have requirements.<br>To further our requirements gathering we carried out semi-structured interviews with pseudo-users. We chose to carry out semi-structured interviews to ensure that we would always get answers to the questions we had prepared, but also allowed us to probe deeper by asking additional questions if the interviewee said anything insightful that we had not considered initially. This ensured that the requirements we gathered were a truer reflection of what a user would look for in a medical model viewer application.<br>Over the course of the development of our project, we met with our clients on a weekly basis. Our requirements have been expanded upon and subject to change over the course of development based on the requests of our clients, but by meeting and demonstrating our progress frequently, we've ensured that our application is indeed delivering what our clients had in mind.</p>

For example, some ICONS do not match to their functions, which will make users feel confused as they do not understand the meaning of each button in the process of use. In addition, the whole UI design was too colourful and may cause users to lose focus on the model while using our application.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 30px;">In order to solve these problems, we finally turned to a design approach that has recently emerged -- the Neumorphism. Neumorphism is a graphical style that works by giving realism to the elements of a user interface. Its advantage is that the screen is extremely simple, easy to highlight the main body, and will give the user the feeling of&nbsp; "this software is very easy to use".</p>

                <h3 class = "section-heading text-uppercase">Design Patterns</h3>
                <h4 class = "my-3">Singleton pattern</h4>
                <p class = "my-3"> A number of the classes in our codebase are dependent on the properties of the loaded model (such as its centre and radius). The <b>ModelHandler</b> class  
                    holds a reference to the <b>Organ</b> object, which is an abstract class that represents the loaded model. The ModelHandler class is responsible for loading in the Organ (see the <i>Model loading and initialisation</i> class diagram below), but also calculating the properties of the loaded Organ that the other classes rely on.
                    In order to provide other classes ease of access to these properties, ModelHandler is made a singleton. Although the Singleton pattern is often seen as an antipattern, its use here is appropriate
                    as only one model is ever loaded into the application at any given time. Our <b>EventManager</b> class (see below) is also a singleton.
                </p>
                <h4 class = "my-3">Publisher-Subscriber pattern</h4>
                <p> To reduce the dependencies between classes in our codebase we utilised the Publisher-Subscriber pattern. To do this, we created the <b>EventManager</b> class. The EventManager holds a reference to a number of different events, each of which is designed to trigger a certain action within the application. Each event has a corresponding public method which can be called to invoke the event. As the class is a singleton, any class can trigger these events without a reference to the EventManager, and any class can subscribe to these events without a reference to the EventManager.  
                    So for instance, a button can fire an event when clicked. Any scripts that relate to this button will subscribe to this event. However, these scripts do not break if this button is deleted, nor does the button break if the scripts are deleted. Neither party requires a reference to one another as all communication is handled by the EventManager. Any class that listens for events implements the <b>IEventManagerListener</b> interface.</p>
                <h4 class = "my-3">Factory pattern</h4>
                <p>Our application is shipped with six example glb models that can be viewed by the user. These can be selected from a dropdown menu. Each example model is represented by a corresponding class that is a subclass of the abstract Organ class. We use the <b>OrganFactory</b> class to instantiate the appropriate subclass of Organ
                based on the model chosen to view by the user at runtime. If the user chooses to load a model from local storage, the default concrete subclass of the abstract Organ class is instantiated. </p>

                    these objects. This same data can be used to reinitialise the state of the scene when a particular annotation is selected.

                <p class="text-body">Our application loads and renders GLB AND GLTF files at runtime. Unity, however, does not natively support these file types. In order to load the models into the application
                    we made use of <a href="https://github.com/Siccity/GLTFUtility">GLTFUtility</a>, an open source library that supports runtime import of GLB/GLTF files into Unity. It converts the data in the GLB/GLTF files into a number of Unity GameObjects with a MeshFilter
                    ,MeshRenderer and Material component attached. Each of these GameObjects represents a segment of the loaded model.

                        <li>The Materials component determines how the surface of the model is rendered (the colour of the model, how it interacts with Unity lights and how much of the geometry
                            should be drawn to the screen). </li>

                    use here is appopriate since there is only ever one model being renderered in the scene. The size and position of the model do directly influence a number of other classes, so having ModelHandler as singleton
                    prevents them from needing to hold a reference a ModelHandler object.

                    The displacement (in the z axis) of the camera from the pivot is determined by how much the user has zoomed in/out on the view of the model.
                    Every frame, the camera's position is set equal to the position of the pivot. It is then rotated using the rotate method, and translated away from the 
                    pivot using the <b>Translate</b> method. This creates the desired effect, in that the camera is always centered on the pivot.

                    This radius is also used to determine the <i>scrollspeed</i> attribute of the CameraController class, which means the speed at which the user can zoom in is

                <p class="text-body">To implement this feature we made use of <i>surface shaders</i> written in High Level Shader Language.
                    Surface shaders provide a code generation approach to writing shaders that interact with light in Unity. 
                    The concept that our cross-sectional viewer shader employs is similar to the idea of  <i>occlusion culling</i>, in which an object will only be rendered by a camera if it is between the near and far clipping planes of the camera. 
                    If an object is partially between these two planes, only its polygons between the two planes will be drawn to the screen.
                    Our shader (which we based heavily on <a href="url">this open-source shader</a>, as well as the shaders included in the GLTFUtility library that were already being used) determines which pixels of the model should not be drawn to the screen,
                    based on the position and orientation of a plane that can be controlled by the user using sliders.<br> If the <b>dot product</b> of:
                    <ui>
                        <li>The distance between the <i>world space</i> position of the pixel on the model currently being evaluated by the shader and the centre of the plane <b>AND</b></li>

                    is positive, then the current pixel is <b>above</b> the plane, so is discarded.

                    the model itself as this radius represents the bounding sphere of the renderer of the model.
                    When the user first presses the cross-sectional view icon, the plane controller is enabled and a different shader is applied to the model. This shader turns the pixels above the plane black, but is otherwise
                    very similar to the shader above.

Our clients would provide us with feedback on the project with each iteration we sent, often making suggestions on how things could be changed. Although this testing was relatively informal, it was hugely beneficial in that:
<ul>
<li>It allowed our clients to have a hands-on experience of using our application, which made it much easier for them to comment on our progress (compared to us simply sharing our screen and demonstrating our progress). This made the feedback they 
                            provided more valuable, as the feedback was generated from actual experience using the application. The following requirements from our MoSCoW list were actually gathered from our clients testing and providing feedback on iterations of the application:
                        <ul>
                            <br>
                            <li>Have tool-tips appear over elements of the GUI when the pointer hovers over them.</li>
                            <li>Allow the user to change the position about which the camera is centred.</li>
                            <li>Have a full-screen mode of the application, which hides all GUI elements. </li>
                            <li>Allow the user to change the brightness of the background.</li>
                            <br>
                        </ul> 
                        <li>In addition to testing usability, this process served as a form of compatibility testing. Sending these builds allowed us to verify that our application would run correctly on Windows devices beyond the devices it was being developed on. Specifically, we were able to verify 
                            that our GUI scaled well for different screen sizes.

                            <li>Adding a pan feature on the middle mouse button alongside the keyboard controls would improve ease of use.</li>
                            <li>It would be optimal if the opacity slider is unique to each segment, resetting when viewing each segments.</li>
                            <li>Providing an option to change size of the navigation bar, colour wheel and all other features on the UI would allow for easier visualisation especially when zooming into intricate sections of the segmentation.</li>

                    <p class = "my-3">The nature of our application made it fundamentally difficult to Unit Test. As our application is built in Unity, the majority of our classes inherit from the MonoBehaviour class.
                        Unlike other classes in C#, MonoBehaviours cannot be instantiated directly, but must be instead attached to an existing Unity GameObject using the <i>AddComponent&lt&gt</i> function. Furthermore, due to a number of classes being
                        dependent on the loaded model, testing individual modules of code proved difficult. <br>
                        However, using the Unity Testing FrameWork, we were able to create tests to verify a few of the core functionalities of our system. Namely, we wrote tests to verify that the Events of our EventManager class could be invoked and received
                        by the relevant listener classes, whether the models were being loaded with the expected number of segments and that our AnnotationData objects could be parsed to and from JSON. </p>

As the whole user interface is designed in the style of Neumorphism,&nbsp;we believe our UI meets our goals. All images in our application (except for the clients' logos) are designed by using Adobe Photoshop. In order to improve the user experience, we sent our application to our clients, friends and families, and received a lot of positive feedback from them. After constant modification and attempt, our UI becomes better. To give an example, we modified some icons to make their appearance and function do match. And since our users have a wide range of ages, this simple and intuitive design will make it easier for older users to use, while still being fashionable. As a result, we have a lot of confidence in our UI. </p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;">If we had more time, we will try to add the following features:</p><p style="text-align: left;">
    <ul>
<li>Our application could be fully  integrated into the existing HoloRepository ecosystem. The existing HoloRepository is an open-source research project that uses pre-trained neural networks to convert from DICOM scans to GLB and GLTF files. Most of the example models included in our applications were actually generated using the HoloRepository.
Future versions of our system could allow the clinician to select DICOMs which would then be converted into glb/gltf files using the HoloRepository before being rendered. This would be particularly useful in conjunction with the DICOM viewing feature, as they would be able to view the original scans alongside the model.</li>
<li>Secondly, higher fidelity rendering of the models could be carried out, which could involve more detailed texturing and raytracing. This is something that is already being looked into by a third year student.</li>
<li>Thirdly, the application could be made cross platform, so that clinicians and educators could use it on other Operating systems, as well as  their phones and tablets.</li>
<li>Finally, the ability to open the application from well formatted URL links. The parameters of these links could include the model file to be loaded, along with the attributes of the AnnotationData class that we are currently using to store scene state. Clicking on one of these links would render the model passed as the parameter, and immediately take the user to the view of the model determined by the other parameters. </li>
</ul>
