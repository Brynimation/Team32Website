## 12/01/2021 - 18/01/2020
This week our main focus was on preparing for the elevator pitch.  
The pitch can be watched [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11eHAercDwc7xrlxf-W547Wou5UCZGVTd/view?usp=sharing)

During the rest of the week we started looking into how we might implement the colour palette feature. In the GUI design, Shuai included a circular colour palette. We want the user to be able to click and drag the palette to make it rotate, and also allow the user to double click on a particular section of the palette in order to change the currently selected segment that colour. We'll be looking more into this next week,
Daniel also informed us that he has applied for an interruption to his studies. So, from next week he will no longer be able to contribute to the project. We'll make sure to mention this in our next client meeting.
